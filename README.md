## What is

Another weekend project of mine, my first HTML5 app. Aruku is a simple HTML5 Web app to make a request to [alc.co.jp](http://alc.co.jp) to **translate Japanese from and to English**. I really like alc cause the result of their translation is more useful than other services I've tried like Google Translate.

## Demo

Open Safari in your iPhone/iPod, go to [http://nicosakura.no-ip.info/Aruku/](http://nicosakura.no-ip.info/Aruku/)
